ConfTool Sync for Drupal
========================

Import the members of a [ConfTool][ct] conference into a Drupal organic group.

A Drupal block pre-fills the ConfTool conference form with the user data.

Admin Settings
--------------

Under /admin/settings/conftool_connect you can set the following options:

* The name of the conference. It is encouraged to add an Organic Group with the same title.
* The conference ID. Part of the ConfTool URL.
* A describing text of the conference.
* Login credentials of a ConfTool user who has admin access to the conference.
